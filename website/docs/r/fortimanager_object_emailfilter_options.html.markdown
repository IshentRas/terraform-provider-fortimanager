  dns_timeout = 17
}
```

## Argument Reference


The following arguments are supported:

* `scopetype` - The scope of application of the resource. Valid values: `inherit`, `adom`, `global`. The `inherit` means that the scopetype of the provider will be inherited, and adom will also be inherited. The default value is `inherit`.
* `adom` - Adom. This value is valid only when the `scopetype` is `adom`, otherwise the value of adom in the provider will be inherited.

* `dns_timeout` - DNS query time out (1 - 30 sec).


## Attribute Reference

In addition to all the above arguments, the following attributes are exported:
* `id` - an identifier for the resource.

```

$ export "FORTIMANAGER_IMPORT_TABLE"="true"
$ terraform import fortimanager_object_emailfilter_options.labelname ObjectEmailfilterOptions
