## Argument Reference


The following arguments are supported:

* `scopetype` - The scope of application of the resource. Valid values: `inherit`, `adom`, `global`. The `inherit` means that the scopetype of the provider will be inherited, and adom will also be inherited. The default value is `inherit`.
* `adom` - Adom. This value is valid only when the `scopetype` is `adom`, otherwise the value of adom in the provider will be inherited.

* `color` - GUI icon color.
* `comment` - Comment.
* `member` - Address group members.
* `name` - Address group name.
* `uuid` - Universally Unique Identifier (UUID; automatically assigned but can be manually reset).
* `visibility` - Enable/disable address visibility. Valid values: `disable`, `enable`.



## Attribute Reference

In addition to all the above arguments, the following attributes are exported:
* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format {{name}}.
