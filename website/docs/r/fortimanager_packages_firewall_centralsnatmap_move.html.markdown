* `adom` - Adom. This value is valid only when the `scopetype` is `adom`, otherwise the value of adom in the provider will be inherited.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all the above arguments, the following attributes are exported:
* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format {{policyid}}.
* `state_pos` - The parameter is read-only, it is used to get the lastest relative position of the two items. This can help check whether the latest relative position of the two items matches the configuration, and help check whether they have been deleted. If the latest relative position of the two items matches the configuration, the value of state_pos is an empty string.

## Others

~> **Warning:** Since the central snat map changes caused by modifications outside the terraform may be beyond the control of the resource, terraform destroy for the resource will not restore the original sequence state of central snat maps.
